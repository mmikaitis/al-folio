I am a Research Associate with the [Numerical Linear Algebra Group](https://nla-group.org) at the University of Manchester, working with [Professor Nicholas J. Higham](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/index.php). In the 2019/20 academic year I was an [EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow](https://epsrc.ukri.org/skills/students/dta/doctoralprize/) with the same group. I received a B.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Computer Science in 2016 and a PhD degree in Computer Science in 2020, both from the University of Manchester.

During my doctoral degree I was part of two neuromorphic computing projects, called SpiNNaker and SpiNNaker 2, that aim to build efficient spiking neural network (SNN) simulators. There I explored numerical aspects and performance of SpiNNaker software and developed hardware accelerators for elementary functions in SpiNNaker 2.

My research interests include computer arithmetic and related topics: computer arithmetic (fixed- and floating-point software/hardware arithmetics), numerical linear algebra, high-performance computing, mathematical software, performance optimization and benchmarking.

Main programming and software skills: C, MATLAB, Python, CUDA, Verilog, ARM assembly, Git, LaTeX, Bash.

I occasionally contribute to the [NLA group blog](https://nla-group.org/blog/).
